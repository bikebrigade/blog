Jenna Blumenthal has been described as "brilliant", "delightful", and "modest" by her friends and associates. Her modesty has led one of her associates to write this bio for her, making this use of third person entirely natural and warranted.

At the Bike Brigade, Jenna manages relationships with some of our partners and works on our [dispatching software](https://github.com/bikebrigade/dispatch), where her focus is on making the experience for our dispatchers and campaign leads as seemless as possible.

In her day job, Jenna is a Senior Software Engineer at Shopify. And somehow on top of all this she finds time to be an avid cyclist and rock climber.

In her own words:

> **What's your favourite bike lane?**
>
> That little stretch of Shaw accessible only to bikes! Though the new Bayview lanes are pretty great too â€“ feels like a bicycle highway!
