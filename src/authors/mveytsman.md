# {{name}}

Max is a founding organizer with Bike Brigade and the creator and lead maintainer of Bike Brigade’s dispatching software. 

He has been a software engineer, a security consultant, a YC-founder and is now devoting his time to making mutual aid tech happen. While doing so, he “accidentally” became a [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) maintainer, and “on purpose” mentors other developers interested in the intersection of technology and mutual aid work.
