This October, I had the opportunity to talk about Bike Brigade's tech stack at [ElixirConf](https://www.elixirconf.com/).

They say that when crafting a talk, you should focus on three things that you want your audience to get out of the talk. Here's what I wanted to get across to the Elixir community.mfdsmdfsdmsf fads safdsdf fds fads fsda fads dfssdaf fdas f dafs adsf d fs sdf asdf

1. You have power. LiveView gives you superpowers.
2. Use your (super)powers for good in your community.
3. Bike Brigade's software is open source: https://github.com/bikebrigade/dispatch.
