# A blog from Bike Brigade's tech team

Welcome to the tech blog from <a href="https://www.bikebrigade.ca/" target="_blank">Bike Brigade!</a>

Bike Brigade pairs volunteer cyclists with community organizations that serve isolated and vulnerable communities to deliver essentials. The Bike Brigade offers free delivery service for organizations and individuals in need.

Here you will find stories behind the tech that supports the Bike Brigade's initiatives.

What began with spreadsheets and a dream has evolved into an open source app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/bikebrigade/dispatch).
